# Caeser Cipher Algorithm

## Introduction

Caesar Cipher is an algorithm used in the history by the Roman emperor Julius Caesar. Caesar Cipher uses a fixed key k, with 1 ≤ k ≤ 25, and every character of the plain-text is shifted by the fixed key k to a new character.

## How it works

The program inputs a message from the user and encrypts it using caeser shift. The first part of the project encrypts it using caeser shift. The second part decrypts the encrypted message using caeser shift or brute force technique if caeser shift is not known.

## Steps
  1) Encrypts a message using caeser cipher
  2) Decrypts the message using the cipher key. If the key is not available, it extracts the message using brute force
